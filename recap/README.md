1. (8 points) Implement the interpreter of the imperative language defined in [recap/src/Imp/Lang.hs](recap/src/Imp/Lang.hs)

## Notes 

* Make a fork of this repository and checkout the branch `HW01`.
* Write your code in the [recap/src/Imp/Eval.hs](recap/src/Imp/Eval.hs) file: replace `undefined` with your definitions.
* There are some small programs defined in [recap/src/Imp/Programs.hs](recap/src/Imp/Programs.hs) which are evaluated in [recap/app/Main.hs](recap/app/Main.hs) -- make sure that your interpreter works correctly. 
* It would be lovely if you add more programs to test the behavior of you interpreter. 
* When finished, open a pull request into the main repo. Make sure to *put your name* in the title of the PR.
